The `STRFTIME` function is a powerful date and time formatting function in SQLite (and many other SQL dialects).  `'%Y'` specifies that we want to extract the year in a four-digit format (e.g., 2023).  The `Date` column is assumed to be in a format that SQLite can understand (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS', or a Unix timestamp).  If your `Date` column is in a different format, you might need to adjust this part of the query.  For example, if your date is stored as text in the format 'MM/DD/YYYY', you might need to use `STRFTIME('%Y', SUBSTR(Date, 7, 4) || '-' || SUBSTR(Date, 1, 2) || '-' || SUBSTR(Date, 4, 2))`.  This would reformat the date string into a format SQLite can understand.\n",
